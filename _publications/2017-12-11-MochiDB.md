permalink: /publication/2017-12-11-MochiDB
excerpt: 'In this paper we would like to present MochiDB - a consistent, high volume, distributed datastore which is
Byzantine fault tolerant. MochiDB supports native transactions and uses BFT quorum protocol with random
write seeds that requires only two round trips for writes and one for read which gives it low latency over WAN
deployments. This paper puts focus on engineering solutions that minimize the cost of contention resolution,
sharding, dynamic configuration changes, garbage collection and others.'

In this paper we would like to present MochiDB - a consistent, high volume, distributed datastore which is
Byzantine fault tolerant. MochiDB supports native transactions and uses BFT quorum protocol with random
write seeds that requires only two round trips for writes and one for read which gives it low latency over WAN
deployments. This paper puts focus on engineering solutions that minimize the cost of contention resolution,
sharding, dynamic configuration changes, garbage collection and others.
